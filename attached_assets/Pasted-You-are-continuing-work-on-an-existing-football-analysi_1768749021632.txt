You are continuing work on an existing football analysis blog that uses Editor.js
with JSON-based content storage and proper rendering.

Your task is to enhance the WRITING and READING experience
WITHOUT changing the public-facing design.

========================
1. EDITOR.JS BLOCK SET (MANDATORY)
========================

Extend the Editor.js configuration to include a professional minimum block set:

- Paragraph (default)
- Header (for section titles)
- List (ordered and unordered)
- Quote
- Image (already present)

Use official Editor.js tools where available:
- @editorjs/header
- @editorjs/list
- @editorjs/quote
- @editorjs/image

Ensure:
- Blocks work seamlessly in both create and edit modes
- Existing content remains compatible
- No visual regressions on public pages

========================
2. READING EXPERIENCE (TYPOGRAPHY)
========================

Improve article readability using typography utilities:

- Apply a professional prose/typography layer to post detail pages
- Use a solution such as Tailwind Typography (`prose`)
- Ensure:
  - Proper spacing between paragraphs
  - Clear heading hierarchy
  - Lists and quotes are visually distinct
  - Images integrate naturally with text flow

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT change fonts, colors, or layout structure
- This is purely for readability and semantic spacing

========================
3. CONSTRAINTS
========================

- Do NOT modify homepage, post previews, or admin UI styling
- Do NOT introduce custom blocks yet
- Do NOT refactor unrelated parts of the system
- Focus ONLY on:
  - Editor.js block completeness
  - Clean reading experience on post pages

========================
EXPECTED RESULT
========================

- Writers can structure articles clearly using headings, lists, and quotes
- Readers get a clean, professional, editorial reading experience
- The system is ready for future advanced blocks (scouting, data, tactics)

After implementation, clearly state:
- Which Editor.js blocks are enabled
- How typography is applied
