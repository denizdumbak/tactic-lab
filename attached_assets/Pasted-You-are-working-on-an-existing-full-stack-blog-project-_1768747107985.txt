You are working on an existing full-stack blog project.
Your task is to refactor and extend the system according to the following strict requirements.
Do NOT redesign or restyle any existing public-facing pages unless explicitly mentioned.
Preserve the current UI/UX as much as possible.

========================
1. POST PREVIEW FIXES
========================

1.1 Categories in post previews must display proper Turkish characters.
- Categories are stored as ASCII slugs in the database (e.g. "mac-analizi", "taktik").
- Implement a mapping layer so that:
  - "mac-analizi" → "MAÇ ANALİZİ"
  - "taktik" → "TAKTİK"
  - "scouting" → "SCOUTING"
- Do NOT attempt string replacements or locale-based hacks.
- Use a central mapping file/constants.

1.2 Post previews must ALWAYS display a featured image.
There are TWO types of posts in the system:

A) Existing sample / dummy posts (already in the project)
B) Future real posts (created via the new writer panel)

Rules:
- Every post preview on the homepage MUST show an image.
- For dummy/sample posts:
  - If `imageUrl` is missing, automatically use a static placeholder / representative image.
  - These placeholder images can be generic and hardcoded.
- For real posts:
  - `imageUrl` (featured image) MUST be mandatory.
  - If a real post does not have `imageUrl`, it must NOT be rendered in post previews.
- Do NOT show empty image containers.
- Featured image is ONLY for previews (not inline content).
- Layout, spacing, and hover behavior must remain unchanged.
- Styling should stay consistent with the current TotalFootballAnalysis-style grid.

Implement this using:
- A clear distinction between dummy posts and real posts (e.g. a flag like `isDummy`)
- Explicit logic (no hacks, no silent fallbacks for real posts)

========================
2. REMOVE PUBLIC WRITE ACCESS
========================

2.1 The current writer/admin page is publicly visible at `/write`.
- Remove ALL links to this page from the public site (footer, header, anywhere).
- `/write` must no longer be accessible.

2.2 Create a NEW, NON-GUESSABLE writer/admin route.
- Use a professional, non-obvious path (not `/write`, `/admin`, or `/editor`).
- Do NOT expose this route anywhere in the public UI.
- Assume access control will be enforced later; for now, obscurity + removal from UI is required.

========================
3. NEW WRITER / ADMIN PANEL (REBUILD COMPLETELY)
========================

Rebuild the writer interface from scratch.

3.1 Capabilities required:
- View ALL existing posts
- Edit posts
- Delete posts
- Create new posts
- This page is ONLY for content management

3.2 Editor requirements (CRITICAL):
- Replace the current primitive post creation system entirely.
- Use a free-form rich text editor similar to Medium or Word.
- The editor must support:
  - Title
  - Subtitle
  - Body
  - Bold
  - Italic
  - Inline image insertion at ANY position in the text

3.3 Editor technology:
- Editor.js is strongly recommended.
- Use Editor.js Image Tool (or equivalent plugin) for image insertion.
- If you know a better lightweight alternative that satisfies all requirements, you may propose it, but default to Editor.js.
- External libraries ARE allowed.

3.4 Image handling inside the editor:
- Inserted images must have a fixed standard size.
- Use a professional editorial standard such as 1920x1080.
- Images must not break layout consistency.
- Upload/storage implementation can be simple but must function correctly.

3.5 Featured image vs inline images:
- Featured image (`imageUrl`) is ONLY for post previews.
- Inline images are part of the post content and handled by the editor.
- These are strictly separate concepts.

========================
4. CONSTRAINTS
========================

- Do NOT change the styling of existing public pages.
- Do NOT refactor unrelated parts of the app.
- Focus ONLY on:
  - Post previews (category + image behavior)
  - Writer/admin system
- Keep the codebase clean, modular, and maintainable.
- Prefer explicit mappings and constants over magic strings.
- When finished, clearly output:
  - The new writer/admin route
  - A brief summary of changes

========================
GOAL
========================

The result should feel like a professional editorial football analysis platform:
- Clean public reading experience
- Consistent, image-driven homepage
- Powerful, Medium-like writing experience
- No accidental public access to writing tools
