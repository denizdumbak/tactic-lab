You are working on an existing full-stack blog platform that already uses Editor.js
for content creation.

There is a critical architectural issue:
Editor.js content is currently being saved or rendered as raw HTML strings,
which causes HTML tags (<p>, <img>, etc.) to appear as plain text on the post detail page.

Your task is to FIX this using the CORRECT and PROFESSIONAL Editor.js approach.

========================
REQUIRED CHANGES (MANDATORY)
========================

1. CONTENT STORAGE (BACKEND)
- Editor.js content MUST be stored as structured JSON (Editor.js output format).
- DO NOT convert Editor.js output to HTML before saving.
- Update the Post schema so that:
  - `content` is JSON / JSONB (not text, not HTML).
- Ensure existing dummy or test posts are migrated or safely handled.

2. CONTENT RENDERING (FRONTEND)
- Implement proper Editor.js rendering on the post detail page.
- Use a reliable Editor.js renderer (e.g. editorjs-react-renderer or equivalent).
- The renderer must correctly display:
  - Paragraphs
  - Inline images
  - Captions
  - Future Editor.js blocks without breaking
- DO NOT use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

3. IMAGE BLOCK HANDLING
- Inline images inserted via Editor.js Image Tool must:
  - Render inline at the correct position
  - Respect max-width and layout constraints
  - Maintain professional article flow
- Featured image (`imageUrl`) remains separate and is NOT part of the editor content.

4. BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
- If any existing posts contain legacy HTML content:
  - Handle them gracefully OR
  - Clearly separate legacy content from Editor.js JSON content
- Do NOT break existing public pages.

5. CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT change public styling or layout.
- Do NOT refactor unrelated parts of the app.
- Focus ONLY on:
  - Correct Editor.js data flow (JSON → Renderer)
  - Fixing the broken post reading experience

========================
EXPECTED RESULT
========================

- Editor.js content is saved as JSON.
- Post detail pages render rich text and images correctly.
- No raw HTML tags are visible to users.
- The system follows Editor.js best practices and is future-proof.

When finished, clearly state:
- How content is stored
- Which renderer is used
- What was changed and why
